About
=========

The `sasquatch` project is a set of patches to the standard unsquashfs utility (part of squashfs-tools) that attempts to add support for as many hacked-up vendor-specific SquashFS implementations as possible.

If the vendor has done something simple like just muck a bit with the header fields, `sasquatch` should sort it out.

If the vendor has made changes to the underlying LZMA compression options, or to how these options are stored in the compressed data blocks, `sasquatch` will attempt to automatically resolve such customizations via a brute-force method.

Additional advanced command line options have been added for testing/debugging.

Very beta.

Prerequisites
=============

You need a C/C++ compiler, plus the liblzma, liblzo and zlib development libraries

For most distributions, use:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential liblzma-dev liblzo2-dev zlib1g-dev
```

For *Cygwin*, use either the original [apt-cyg](https://github.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg) or maintained [apt-cyg](https://github.com/kou1okada/apt-cyg) with: 
```bash
$ apt-cyg install patch liblzma-devel liblzo2-devel zlib-devel
```

Installation
============

The included `build.sh` script will download squashfs-tools v4.3, patch the source, then build and install `sasquatch`:

```bash
$ ./build.sh
```
